# FoodTracker

This app is supposed to give you the ability to track your meals by including a name, picture, and rating. It follows closely the development tutorial included in Apple's online documentation for building iOS apps in Swift.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me. This is the first project I've ever written and completed in Swift, aside from playgrounds files available on Apple's developer portal.
